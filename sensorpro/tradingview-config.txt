These settings are added in the DNS control panel for your domain.

SPF Record: 
This setting authorises our servers to send email from your domain.

DKIM Record: 
This is a digital signature on your domain that matches an internal 
signature on our side, authenticating the email as being a genuine email.

DMARC: 
This is a setting that works with the two settings above and adds another 
level of authentication. If you let me know when they are in place, I 
will verify that they are set up correctly.

Here are the settings for your domain. Someone with access to your
